- Allow user to check a task is done and have it update on the page instead of going to a form
- Include some sort of budget functionality where the user can keep track of estimatesd cost vs actual cost
- When viewing the festival detail page-- they page would have links to purchase tickets, include information about the genre of festival, map view of the location of  the festival and the lineup poster for the festival
